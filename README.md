# Prelude

**The open standard for machine-readable codebase context.**

Prelude transforms your codebase into structured, AI-optimized context that makes working with LLMs 10x more effective.

## Why Prelude?

Every time you start a new conversation with an AI assistant, you're forced to explain:
- What stack you're using
- How your codebase is organized  
- What patterns and constraints you follow
- What decisions have been made

**Prelude solves this.**

Instead of repeating yourself, run `prelude export` and get a comprehensive, AI-optimized context document that captures:

- ✅ Your technology stack
- ✅ Project architecture and patterns
- ✅ Development constraints and preferences
- ✅ Key decisions and their rationale
- ✅ Recent changes and work sessions

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g prelude-context

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
prelude init

# Generate AI-optimized context
prelude export
```

The export is automatically copied to your clipboard - just paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, or any LLM!

## What Makes Prelude Different?

| Feature | Prelude | Manual Context | Other Tools |
|---------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Automatic inference | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Standards-based | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Human-readable | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Machine-optimized | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Version controlled | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Zero configuration | ✅ | N/A | ❌ |

## Core Commands

### `prelude init`
Analyzes your codebase and creates a `.context/` directory with:
- `project.json` - Project metadata
- `stack.json` - Technology stack
- `architecture.json` - Architecture patterns and structure
- `constraints.json` - Development rules and preferences
- `decisions.json` - Architecture decision records
- `changelog.md` - Project timeline

All files follow the [Prelude specification](./SPEC.md) and include JSON Schema validation.

### `prelude export`
Generates a markdown document optimized for LLMs:
- Combines all context into a single, focused document
- Automatically copied to clipboard
- Perfect for starting new AI conversations

### `prelude decision <title>`
Logs architecture decisions:
```bash
prelude decision "Use Drizzle ORM instead of Prisma"
# Opens editor for you to document the decision and rationale
```

### `prelude watch`
Tracks development sessions:
```bash
prelude watch
# Monitors file changes and logs your work session
# Press Ctrl+C when done to save the session
```

---

## Use Cases

### 🎯 Starting New Conversations
Paste your Prelude export to instantly give any LLM full context:

```
Here's my project context:

[paste prelude export]

I want to add user authentication. What's the best approach given our stack?
```

### 🐛 Debugging
```
Here's my project context:

[paste prelude export]

I'm seeing this error: [error]
In file: apps/web/app/api/route.ts

What's likely causing this?
```

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions
```
Here's my project context:

[paste prelude export]

Should I use Server Actions or API routes for [feature]?
Consider our existing patterns and constraints.
```

### 📚 Onboarding
Share your `.context/` directory with new team members so they can:
- Understand the stack instantly
- Learn architectural patterns
- See past decisions and rationale

## The Prelude Format

Prelude is an **open standard** - not just a CLI tool. The format is:
- **Versioned** - Semantic versioning for safe evolution
- **Validated** - JSON Schema for every file type
- **Extensible** - Add custom fields as needed
- **Language-agnostic** - Implement in any language

See the [full specification →](./SPEC.md)

All schemas are hosted at: `https://adjective.us/prelude/schemas/v1/`

---

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Edits
The `.context/` files are human-readable JSON. Edit them directly:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://adjective.us/prelude/schemas/v1/constraints.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mustUse": [
    "TypeScript strict mode",
    "Server Components by default"
  ],
  "preferences": [
    {
      "category": "state-management",
      "preference": "Prefer URL state over client state",
      "rationale": "Improves sharability and reduces bugs"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Fields
Add project-specific fields - the schemas allow additional properties:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://adjective.us/prelude/schemas/v1/project.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "my-app",
  "customField": "your data",
  "team": [
    { "name": "Alice", "role": "Tech Lead" }
  ]
}
```

### Integration
Use Prelude in your tools:

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Read project context
const project = JSON.parse(
  readFileSync(join(process.cwd(), '.context/project.json'), 'utf-8')
);

console.log(`Project: ${project.name}`);
console.log(`Stack: ${project.stack?.language}`);
```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Git (optional, for tracking changes)

---

## Project Structure

```
your-project/
├── .context/              # Created by Prelude
│   ├── project.json      # Project metadata
│   ├── stack.json        # Technology stack  
│   ├── architecture.json # Architecture patterns
│   ├── constraints.json  # Development rules
│   ├── decisions.json    # Architecture decisions
│   └── changelog.md      # Project timeline
├── .gitignore            # Add .context/*.session.json
└── ...
```

**Note:** Commit `.context/` to version control (except `*.session.json` files).

---

## FAQ

### Should I commit `.context/` to git?
**Yes!** The context is part of your project documentation. Exception: `.context/*.session.json` should be gitignored (it's for local work tracking).

### How often should I update the context?
Prelude auto-updates timestamps. Run `prelude export` whenever you need fresh context for an AI conversation. Update the JSON files manually when you make architectural changes.

### Can I use this with any LLM?
Yes! The export format is optimized for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and any text-based AI assistant.

### What if my project structure is unusual?
Prelude's inference is smart but not perfect. Just edit the `.context/` files directly - they're human-readable JSON.

### Does this work with non-JavaScript projects?
Yes! While the CLI is built with Node.js, the Prelude format works with any language. The inference currently focuses on JavaScript/TypeScript but the format is universal.

## Design Principles

1. **Human-readable first** - All files are readable JSON/Markdown
2. **AI-optimized** - Structured for maximum LLM effectiveness  
3. **Standards-based** - Open spec, not proprietary format
4. **Zero lock-in** - Edit files manually, use any tool
5. **Incremental adoption** - Works with partial information
